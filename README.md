Setup (Mars News)

I had trouble with getting the remote browser to work. Ian from the AskBCS team provided the following to assist with setup:

    executable_path = {'executable_path': ChromeDriverManager().install()}
    browser = Browser('chrome', **executable_path, headless=False)

Step 2: Scrape the Website (Mars News)

Step 3: Store the Results (Mars News)
--------------------------------------------------

The following section:

    # Convert to JSON

    print(articles_json)

and:

    # Export to JSON file
    with open("articles_data.json", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(articles_json)

Used the method layed out here:
